# How to run SuperCollider with sound during meetings (Skype/Zoom/etc) on Windows 10

//Before starting any meeting you should first open SuperCollider and Boot the Server

//in that way speakers are not engaged solely by the meeting conference and thus you can run Supercollider with sound

/*if you have a conference meeting on-going and Boot the Server in SuperCollider afterwards, as a consequence the sound of the conference meeting is lost and engaged merely by SuperCollider*/

//so make sure before any meeting to Boot the server in SuperCollider first
